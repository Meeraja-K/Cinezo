Cinezo is a subscription-based entertainment platform that provides users access to a wide range of movies, TV shows, and other media content. The platform is built with a focus on security and scalability, integrating advanced technologies like Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to enhance security and user privacy.

    Key Objectives

    - Security: Implementation of advanced security protocols, including PKI and ZKP, to ensure user data privacy and secure transactions.
    - Scalability: Built with technologies that allow easy scaling to accommodate a growing user base.
    - User Experience: A sleek and intuitive interface to enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

    Features

    - Subscription Management: Users can manage their subscriptions, including plan upgrades, renewals, and cancellations.
    - Secure Access: Uses PKI for certificate-based authentication and ZKP for secure verification without revealing sensitive information.
    - Content Library: A vast collection of movies and TV shows, categorized and searchable.
    - User Dashboard: Personalized user dashboard with viewing history, recommendations, and account settings.

    Technology Stack

    - Backend: Express (Node.js Framework), MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
    - Frontend: React JS (JavaScript Library), CSS (Styling)
    - Security: PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof)
    - Other Dependencies:
        Mongoose: For MongoDB object modeling
        CORS: Middleware for enabling CORS
        body-parser: Middleware for parsing JSON, URL-encoded, and multipart bodies
        snarkjs: For implementing ZKP
        crypto: For cryptographic operations
        fs, path: For file and path operations


    System Architecture
    
    The Cinezo platform is built on a multi-tier architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and efficient management of different components:

    - Frontend: Built using React JS, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
    - Backend: Developed using Express, managing API requests, user authentication, and business logic.
    - Database: MongoDB is used to store user data, subscription details, and content metadata.
    - Security Layer: Integrated PKI and ZKP mechanisms to enhance the security of user transactions and data access.
